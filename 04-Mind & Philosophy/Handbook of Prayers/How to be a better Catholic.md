# Spiritual Game Plan
> Most important is to be consistent in your daily schedule, in your spiritual game plan, so that you will live as a child of God. 
### Daily
- Get up at a fixed time
- Offer your day to God
- Work and study with order and intensity
	- sanctifying ordinary work is the goal of our life
- Do some spiritual reading
- Make a short examination of conscience at the end of the day before going to bed. 3 minutes is enough.
### Monthly
- spend a few hours in a holy hour, best done before Blessed Sacrament
### Yearly
- attend a spiritual retreat each year in silence
### Always
- stay in the presence of God: be aware that she is always close to you. Always remember how much she loves you.
- Thank God for the graces she constantly gives you
- Try to live as you would like to die. We shall die as we have lived.
